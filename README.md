# Gamification In Discussion

This is a collection of key points from two books, __Gamification By Design: Implementing Game Mechanics in Web and Mobile Apps__, and __Actionable Gamification: Beyond Points, Badges, and Leaderboards__. The objective of this repo is to gain insight on how design elements in gamification foster behavioral changes, and increase user engagement, motivation, and retention.
