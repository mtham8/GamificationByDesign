# Gamification In Discussion

We love constructing worlds in Minecraft and trading monsters in Pokemon. We love to rally the troops in Clash of Clans. Games are a huge part of our lives. Games are high-octane learning machines that encourage us to experiment, develop strategies, and learn new skills. Gamification uses the elements of what we love about games and apply them outside of the traditional gaming realm. This is a collection of key points from two books, __Gamification By Design: Implementing Game Mechanics in Web and Mobile Apps__, and __Actionable Gamification: Beyond Points, Badges, and Leaderboards__. The objective of this repo is to gain insight on how design elements in gamification foster behavioral changes, and increase user engagement, motivation, and retention.
